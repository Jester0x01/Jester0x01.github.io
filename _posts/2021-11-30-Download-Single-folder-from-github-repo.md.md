Many times you want to download only a single folder from a github repo but unfortunately github doesn't not provide any official feature to do this. 

But recently I came across one very useful website for downloading single folder.

### How to download single folder

#### Step 1
Go to https://download-directory.github.io/

#### Step 2
 Enter the github repo url with folder path and hit enter 

For example, you want to download  only xss fuzzing payloads from SecLists github repo.

To do this just specify the full path of folder.

`https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/XSS`
